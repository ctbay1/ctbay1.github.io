                            This is a memory game where the player has to remember the order of the red boxes. 
                            The game is implemented using JavaScript and can be played below. 
                            The player first has to wait for the boxes to be revealed, then click on them in the correct order.
                            The game ends when the player makes a mistake.
                            You can restart the game at any time by clicking the restart button.

                            The Ohm's Law calculator can calculate voltage, current, or resistance based on the provided values. 
                            Both calculators are implemented using JavaScript and can be interacted with below.

                                    The chatbot's find_intent function is responsible for classifying the user's intent based on their message.
                                    The chatbot employs a Naive Bayes classifier to determine the intent behind a user's message. 
                                    The classifier has been trained on a carefully curated dataset (intent_data.csv) that encompasses a wide range of user queries and

                                    To enhance the chatbot's ability to handle irrelevant or out-of-scope queries, a probability threshold of 0.2 is employed. 
                                    After the Naive Bayes classifier predicts the intent, the model's confidence in that prediction is assessed. 
                                    If the probability of the predicted intent falls below the threshold, the chatbot defaults to a 
                                    "I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase your question?" response, prompting the user to try again.

                            Building the NLP Project Store chatbot presented several challenges, primarily stemming from the limitations of working with a small dataset,

                                    The limited size of the intent_data.csv dataset posed a significant hurdle. With only a few examples per intent initially, 
                                    the Naive Bayes classifier struggled to generalize and accurately classify user queries, leading to an initial accuracy score of less than 50%. <br>
                                    To address this, an iterative process of data augmentation and refinement was employed:

                                            introducing variations in language while preserving the core intent.

                                            <strong>Error Analysis:</strong> Thorough analysis of the confusion matrix and misclassified examples guided the refinement process, 
                                            highlighting areas where the classifier needed more examples or clarity.

                                    Through these efforts, the accuracy of the intent classifier was significantly improved, ultimately reaching an average score of 95.4% 
                                    across multiple evaluations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of a systematic approach to dataset enhancement, even when working with
